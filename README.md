Module 050 - A decentralized microfinance collaborate saving 
Module 070
Module 033 - Calculate Greatest Number
Objective- Create a function Greaterwhich accepts a dynamic array of unsigned integers. Calculate the greatest number from all of them and return it.
Sample 1 - Input : [23, 56, 23, 46, 76, 8] Output : 76
Sample 2 - Input : [134, 567, 22] Output : 567

Module 068 - CEO of a company, has hired you as an intern. To assess your proficiency in basic Solidity and mathematics, he has assigned you a task.

Your task is to implement a smart contract that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two unsigned integers. Given two positive integers a and b, the GCD of a and b is defined as the greatest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. Your solution must include a public function with the following signature:
The smart contract must contain the following public funtion:

 

function gcd(uint a, uint b) returns (uint): This function should take two unsigned integers as inputs and return the GCD of those two numbers as an unsigned integer output

Module 016
Module 072 - Gavin recently started a chocolate shop and has a bag to keep all of the chocolates, which he calls the "chocolate bag." He regularly imports chocolates from a chocolate factory and sells them to customers through his shop. However, Gavin has a poor memory and often forgets the count of chocolates in the chocolate bag. To solve this issue, he wants to use smart contracts to keep track of the number of chocolates.

The smart contract should be accessible through the following three public functions:

 

Input:
buyChocolates(uint n): This function will allow Gavin to purchase n number of chocolates and add them to the chocolate bag. The input must be an unsigned integer, with the constraint 0 <=n < 2^256.

sellChocolates(uint n): This function will allow Gavin to sell n number of chocolates from the chocolate bag. The input must be an unsigned integer, with the constraint 0 <=n < 2^256.
