Module 072 - Gavin recently started a chocolate shop and has a bag to keep all of the chocolates, which he calls the "chocolate bag." He regularly imports chocolates from a chocolate factory and sells them to customers through his shop. However, Gavin has a poor memory and often forgets the count of chocolates in the chocolate bag. To solve this issue, he wants to use smart contracts to keep track of the number of chocolates.

The smart contract should be accessible through the following three public functions:

 

Input:
buyChocolates(uint n): This function will allow Gavin to purchase n number of chocolates and add them to the chocolate bag. The input must be an unsigned integer, with the constraint 0 <=n < 2^256.

sellChocolates(uint n): This function will allow Gavin to sell n number of chocolates from the chocolate bag. The input must be an unsigned integer, with the constraint 0 <=n < 2^256.
